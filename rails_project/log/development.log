Podczas jego nieobecności przedsiębiorstwem Apple zarządzał Tim Cook.\r\n\r\n14 stycznia 2009 roku Steve Jobs rozesłał mail do pracowników, w którym poinformował o swoim urlopie zdrowotnym. W wiadomości można przeczytać, że jego pierwotne problemy okazały się o wiele poważniejsze niż podejrzewał. Jobs planował powrót do przedsiębiorstwa na wakacje. W czasie jego nieobecności zastąpić go miał Tim Cook[13].\r\n\r\n22 czerwca 2009 roku media podały, iż Jobs przeszedł pomyślnie zabieg przeszczepienia wątroby[14].\r\n\r\n7 stycznia 2011 r. Steve Jobs ponownie udał się na urlop zdrowotny. W międzyczasie postanowił pozostać na stanowisku dyrektora generalnego, deklarując zaangażowanie w najważniejsze decyzje strategiczne przedsiębiorstwa, w tym odpowiedzialność za wszystkie codzienne czynności przedsiębiorstwa z Cupertino.\r\n\r\n24 sierpnia 2011 roku Steve Jobs zrezygnował z funkcji CEO Apple, obejmując stanowisko przewodniczącego rady dyrektorów przedsiębiorstwa. Zastąpił go Tim Cook. Jobs powiedział, że nie mógł już pełnić funkcji CEO tak, aby sprawnie kierować przedsiębiorstwem.
